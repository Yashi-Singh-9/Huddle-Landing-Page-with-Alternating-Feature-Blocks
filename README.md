## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Responsive design techniques

### What I learned

During the development of this project, I learned how to effectively use Flexbox for responsive layouts, particularly for creating alternating feature blocks. I also honed my skills in implementing hover states for interactive elements, which enhances the user experience. Here are a few code snippets I'm proud of:

```html
<header>
  <nav>
    <img src="images/logo.svg" alt="">
    <button class="btn">Try It Free</button>
  </nav>
</header>
```

```css
.service {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  padding: 50px 10px;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue refining my CSS skills, especially in implementing advanced layout techniques using CSS Grid. Additionally, I would like to explore JavaScript interactivity to make the site more dynamic in future projects.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks: Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This guide helped me understand Flexbox better, especially for responsive design.
- [MDN Web Docs: HTML Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) - A comprehensive resource for understanding semantic HTML5 elements.
